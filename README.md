## ABSTRACT

<div align="justify">
  
Using automatic expert system in any industry, could increase the service quality in that area. Also it decreases human error, increases service speed, decreases cost, increases working time with no fatigue and decreases cheating in respective field. So using theses system is so logical in some areas. Maritime commerce and fishery industry is very essential in every countries. But it could be done easier with an automatic expert system assistance. In this paper an automatic expert system for Iran’s maritime commerce and fishery industry is proposed. For implementation CLIPS expert system software has been employed. Also maritime commerce and fishery process details is achieved from three human experts in this field. Validation results between human and automatic expert system using weighted Kappa factor shows high capability of the proposed system. Weighted Kappa is calculated with SPSS software. With agreement level of 0.94 using weighted Kappa factor between second human expert and proposed expert system, robustness and ability of the system validated so satisfactory. System can be used in complex models from academic science to operational advice.
